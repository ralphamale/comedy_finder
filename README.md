# Comedy Finder (incomplete)

I perform a lot of improv, and I wanted to create a tool to help improvisors sign up for Upright Citizens Brigade (UCB) improv classes.

This project is ONGOING.

Here is what it will do:
* Scrape the UCB web site for improv classes whenever they are posted
* Use ActionMailer to notify users who marked that time slot as available

I hope it will be a great help to improvisors everywhere.
